This is a simple ray tracing software by Wang Liao

Made finished on 16th of April, 2021, with love.

The software calculates ray lines according to snell's law and the law of reflection across all surfaces. It treats surfaces of refractive and reflective natures, with both sides of the surface having homogeneous refractive index. Its main advantage is speed. With a large number of rays, the computational time is relatively short. For a more realistic simulation, one may use the Hamiltonian methods, which treats the frequency as the Hamiltonian (hint: Planck's E=hv, energy is Hamiltonian) and using Hamiltonian' equations to compute the trace of the photons. The algorithm has been attempted by the author himself, but he found that speed is much slower than the current one, and it is quite a difficulty to let the algorithm overcome the discontinuous boundaries when applying standard Runge-Kutta methods.
